Reading and Writing a graph from/to a file

Due by Tuesday, December 2nd at the start of lab

The introduction

When I introduced graphs during session 32 we discussed the mathematical representation of a graph.  For example, the following mathematical representation:

G=({1,2,3,4,5,6,7},{(1,2,2),(1,4,1),(2,4,3),(2,5,10),(3,1,4),(3,6,5),(4,3,2),(4,5,2),(4,6,8),(4,7,4),(5,7,6),(7,6,1)})

is how we describe this graph

In this assignment I want you to write a program to read a mathematical representation and produce a Graph() and take an existing Graph() and write out it's mathematical representation.

The requirements

    * In a file called pa07.py write a method called readGraphFromFile().  This method...
          o Takes a single parameter - a string representing the name of an input file.  That file can be assumed to have one "line" of text which is a mathematical representation of a graph as described above.
          o Parses that string into its vertices and edges.
          o Constructs a new graph with the data extracted (using graph.py and vertex.py)
          o Returns this graph
          o You may use the following files to test this method:
                + graph1.txt
                + graph2.txt

       
    * In a file called pa07.py write a second method called writeFileFromGraph().  This method...
          o Takes two parameters
                + a previously constructed graph
                + a string representing the name of an output file
          o Creates a mathematical representation of the graph using the format described above
          o Writes that representation to the provided output file

        

How I will test your code

   1. I will use readGraphFromFile() to read in a graph from a file that I provide (it may or may not be one of the two listed above).
   2. I will add additional verticies and/or edges to the graph that you return in step 1.
   3. I will use writeFileFromGraph() using this modified graph from step 2.
   4. I will use readGraphFromFile() to read in the output file you created in step 3.
   5. I will test the graph returned by step 4 to see if it is the same graph I was working with at the end of step2

If you fail step 5 you have largely failed this assignment.  You may have the two methods described in the requirements section but if you fail step 5 you don't actually have the two methods working properly.

Submitting your assignment

To get full credit for this assignment you must:

    * Produce pa07.py as described above
    * Upload a zip file named pa07.zip which contains
          o pa07.py
          o graph.py (should not have been modified by you)
          o vertex.py (should not have been modified by you)
    * Submit a paper printout of pa07.py
